### PROJECT TITLE: Predicting Client Return for IFSSA Food Hamper Program

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at NorQuest College. This project was developed in collaboration with the **Islamic Family and Social Services Association (IFSSA)** to improve food program planning and resource allocation.

This initiative aims to **predict the likelihood of clients returning for food hamper services**. With a predictive model, IFSSA can better support at-risk individuals, reduce food waste, and improve operational efficiency.

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement

IFSSA faces challenges in predicting which clients will return after receiving a food hamper. This uncertainty makes it difficult to forecast demand, plan inventory, and deliver targeted outreach to clients who may be food insecure but are not returning.

---

### 💡 Solution

We developed a **machine learning model** to predict the likelihood of client return based on:
- 🧾 Hamper pickup history  
- 👤 Demographic features  
- 🎟️ Event participation  
- 📊 Service usage patterns

**Tech Used:**
- **Python** for data processing and modeling  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn, XGBoost** for machine learning modeling  
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)** for handling class imbalance  
- **SHAP** for model explainability  
- **Matplotlib & Plotly** for visualization  
- **Streamlit** for interactive web app development  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration 

The best-performing model achieved over **90% accuracy**, helping identify at-risk clients for targeted engagement.
