### PROJECT TITLE: Predicting Client Return for IFSSA Food Hamper Program

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at NorQuest College. This project was developed in collaboration with the **Islamic Family and Social Services Association (IFSSA)** to improve food program planning and resource allocation.

This initiative aims to **predict the likelihood of clients returning for food hamper services**. With a predictive model, IFSSA can better support at-risk individuals, reduce food waste, and improve operational efficiency.

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement

IFSSA faces challenges in predicting which clients will return after receiving a food hamper. This uncertainty makes it difficult to forecast demand, plan inventory, and deliver targeted outreach to clients who may be food insecure but are not returning.

---

### 💡 Solution

We developed a **machine learning model** to predict the likelihood of client return based on:
- Hamper pickup history
- Demographic features
- Event participation
- Service usage patterns

**Models Used:**
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost

The best-performing model achieved over **90% accuracy**, helping identify at-risk clients for targeted engagement.

- `data/client_data.csv`: Contains anonymized demographic and service usage data  
- `data/hamper_data.csv`: Includes pickup history and hamper service details  
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and model training    
- `README.md`: Overview of the project (you’re here!)
